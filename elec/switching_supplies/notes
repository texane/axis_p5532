there are 3 switching supplies seen in SAM_2519.JPG.

Each supply contains 2 touch points:
. at the inductor left, the output voltage,
. at the inductor right, the power good signal.


TODO:
on the picture, the 3.3V power supply is not the indicated
one but the other, non yet marked, one. It is controlled by
a supervisor IC, the tps3808:
